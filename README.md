mpv-remote
==========

Deployment
----------
Should work by running python3 server.py if you have mpv installed (on Windows this means having mpv.com in your PATH)


If you're having problems with it, try deleting/renaming mpv config files or building the latest git version.

Usage
-----
Open http://example:9876 on your smartphone and you will be
redirected to your home directory. Navigate to media files and
click to play them on your HTPC.
