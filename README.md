Remotely control your HTPC.

Deployment

If you're having problems with it, try deleting/renaming mpv config files or building the latest git version.

Open http://example:9876 on your phone or laptop and you will be
redirected to your home directory. Navigate to media files and
click to play them on your HTPC.
